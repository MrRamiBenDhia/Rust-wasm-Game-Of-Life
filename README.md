# Rust WebAssembly Game of Life 🎮

Welcome to the Rust WebAssembly Game of Life repository! This project implements Conway's Game of Life using Rust and WebAssembly, allowing you to explore the fascinating world of cellular automata right in your browser.

## Overview 🌐

Conway's Game of Life is a classic example of cellular automation, where simple rules give rise to complex behaviors. This project demonstrates the power of Rust combined with WebAssembly to create a performant and visually appealing simulation.

For more information about Conway's Game of Life, please refer to its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Setup ⚙️

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. If not, you can install them from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `wasm-pack build --target web` to build the WebAssembly code.
5. Serve the project locally using your preferred web server. You can use `python -m http.server` or any other server of your choice.
